I watched the latest entry on the Star Wars series yesterday. After leaving the film, I didn't know whether I liked it or not. Apparently, this is not a unique experience, as I've talked to several people who felt the same. The way the plot is presented and the flow of the movie is so tense that you're constantly left thinking about the way the story is going to progress next. This means that there's not much time to just let things sink in!

However, when I woke up today, I spent a little time comfy in bed taking advantage of the fact that it's a lazy Saturday morning, and realized it was easily my second favorite (after Empire, of course. I ruined my VHS tape watching Empire so many times as a kid, so...). I already expected to love it, since Rian Johnson directed most of my favorite episodes in my favorite american TV show ever, Breaking Bad, and I was left with my expectations fully met.

Spoiler-light (but not spoiler-free! notes):
- The way Luke Skywalker is used throughout the movie is not how I would've done it. I don't feel like the fresh-faced boy from Tattooine is there at all inside Mark Hamill's performance... However, the plot neatly explains how exactly Luke became that old man in that weird porg-filled island, and what led him through his path as a hermit.

- I didn't like the way the movie completely cleared the field. Are we just repeating the same conflict repeatedly throughout the third movie? Are we getting a bunch of new characters introduced in the last film of a trilogy? That's never a good sign.

- Phasma finally had an actual role in this one! Wow!

- Adam Driver's performance was good, and he's anime-quality angsty in this one. Top marks.

- As I said before, the movie is REALLY tense, and keeps setting up things and knocking them down in unpredictable ways.
